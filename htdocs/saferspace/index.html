        <h3 class="teal center">Safer Space Policy</h3>
        <p>Isle of Games organizers are dedicated to fostering a safer-space environment at all our events: this means creating a space where all people, of any orientation, gender identity, and race, are respected, accepted and welcome. Harassment and oppression will not be tolerated at this or future events. We realize that no space can be completely safe and free from oppression. Our safer spaces policy exists to minimize oppressive actions, behaviours and language at Isle of Games events.</p>
        <p>Oppressive actions and words include but are not limited to: </p>
        <p class="quote">Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and any expression of disrespect and/or intolerance of size, gender identity, sexual identity/expression, (dis)ability, age, educational level, and cultural background.</p>
        <p>Harassment includes but is not limited to:</p>
        <p class="quote">Deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Guests asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
        <p>Please keep the following points in mind while participating in the event:</p>
        <p class="quote">Your emotional and physical boundaries should be respected. Likewise, respect everyone else&rsquo;s physical and emotional boundaries. Ask first before touching, and listen and change your behavior if you are making anyone feel uncomfortable.</p>
        <p class="quote">You should feel safe asking people not to discuss a topic that might be triggering for you. Everyone should check in before discussing topics that might be triggering (e.g. sexual abuse, sexual experiences, physical violence, or encounters with the police).</p>
        <p class="quote">You are responsible for your own actions. Even if our actions are not intentionally hurtful, what we say and do can hurt others or make them feel uncomfortable.</p>
        <p class="quote">Your chosen pronoun (she/he/they/&hellip;) should be respected by everyone. Also, do not assume anyone&rsquo;s gender identity, sexual preference, economic status, background, health, etc.</p>
        <p>Respect people&rsquo;s needs, opinions, beliefs, experiences and differing points of view.</p>
        <p>Look out if there are kids and animals. Try not to leave anything around that could endanger them or other adults.</p>
        <p>Attendance at Isle of Games events implies that the participants agree to, and will abide by, these rules. Isle of Games reserves the right to ask anyone who is acting in violation of our safer space policy to leave when asked. No refunds will be offered in the case of expulsion from a paid event.</p>
        <p><strong>If someone asks for your help please show solidarity considering this safer space policy.</strong></p>
        <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a Safer Space Ambassador, recognizable by a Safer Space button, see image. You can also reach out to any Isle of Games organizer, or email us at <a href="mailto:hello@isleofgames.is">hello@isleofgames.is</a> and we will address the issue.</p>
        <p><br /><br /></p>
        <p>-</p>
        <p><strong>Note for safe/anonymous reports of harassment</strong></p>
        <p>We believe people should feel safe in reporting issues of harassment. When contacting Isle of Games organizers, by word or mail, your reports will stay anonymous unless otherwise stated. Your privacy is of utmost importance.</p>
        <p>We can be reached at: hello@isleofgames.is</p>

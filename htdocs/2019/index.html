          <p><small><i>(published September 16, 2019)</i></small></p>
<p>We did it again! Sunday, July 28th, we held the second edition of <a href="http://www.isleofgames.is/">Isle of Games</a>. The festival had talks by 8 speakers, 10 new games, and 5 new performances. We had a full house during the talks, a well-attended exhibition and a spectacular night. This article will give you an overview of the proceedings, with links, credits and photos ✨.</p>
<p>Last year, we hoped to bring part of the global alternative game scene into Reykjavik, and showcase it alongside our own work. This year we decided to prioritize our own work, and further inspire local creators to participate and contribute to what we're trying to build. </p>
<p>The article from <a href="https://medium.com/@jonatan.van.hove/how-to-start-a-scene-bef6deb610d6">last year</a> has proven to be a powerful artifact of documentation and inspiration, and we hope this year's will be the same or even better. Spread it far and wide, and let us know what you think. Follow us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/isleofgamesfestival/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/isleofgames/">Instagram</a> for future events. We will update this article when more footage rolls out.</p>

<h2 id="talks">Talks</h2>
<p>We started the day with a series of short artist talks. The speakers include artists from all sorts of artistic disciplines, talking about how their work has touched games, or the other way around. Most of our speakers are based in Reykjavik, but we invited Moshe Linke as a guest to the festival. We recorded the talks, but at the time of writing they are still being edited. (The ones marked with a "🔴" have links to the recording.)</p>

<h2 id="games">Games</h2>
<p>Ten games, ten custom installations, most of which created in Reykjavik (some even made in IÐNÓ). In the case of the installations, it is difficult to credit individuals for something that is largely a group effort, so it is omitted on purpose in some cases.</p>
<h3 id="choosatron">Choosatron</h3>
<p>Returning to Isle of Games with a new set of stories, The Choosatron is an interactive fiction arcade machine that prints as you play. Play stories, make choices and take your story home with you. This year, we commissioned icelandic writers to make new stories, even some in Icelandic. </p>

<h3 id="gale">Gale</h3>
<p>Gale is a two player 2D platformer which involves a character traversing a series of dark landscapes, with only the negative space left by the wind giving shape to the obstacles in your way. One player is the character, the other controls the wind direction, and both of you must work together to navigate your way through the world.  </p>
<p><em>The controller consisted of two pillars, one with a joystick and a button to control the character, and the other with a rotating dial for the wind. The pillars were coated in black vinyl and the caps of the joystick and dial were Icelandic lava stone.</em></p>

<h3 id="gentlydownthemarsh">Gently Down The Marsh</h3>
<p>Gently Down The Marsh is the story of four companions in a canoe, each with their own oar, two to a side. Well, they can switch sides by double tapping their key but they must coordinate and work together to navigate through the twisting bends, the rushing rapids and the hazardous debris. This is a game three friends made together during an 8-hour mini-jam at IÐNÓ.  </p>
<p><em>For isle of games, we built an abstract 4-person rowing boat, and provided life vests (borrowed from the Icelandic Search And Rescue team) for people to get into character. Each seat on the long bench had an oar, with an arcade button attached at the end. Moving the oar had no gameplay effect, yet people paddled away</em>  </p>

<p>Take a walk in a virtual park. Make your way through the maze, have a swim at the beach, stroll through the flower garden or catch the football match.</p>
<p><em>The game was presented on a small patch of (fake) grass, with some crates to sit on. The controls were a simple 4 directional joystick inside another grassy crate. Jói set out to make his game hyper-accessible, and we wanted the installation to support this. Einar drew a wonderful map, which we printed out to guide people around.</em></p>

<h3 id="neobrutalismoftomorrow">Neo-Brutalism of Tomorrow</h3>
<p>A virtual art gallery and features a handful of contemporary works inside a neo brutalist structure. It explores the idea of the space itself being the main experience. How visitors exploring the architecture without any direction or guidance. How natural light and shadows can be used to transform a rough space into a mystical place. How sound behaves in the ever-changing conditions of the architecture. A concept for a future.</p>
<p><em>Debuting at Isle of Games, Neo-Brutalism Of Tomorrow was a game that demanded some privacy, and darkness, which is difficult to provide during summer in Iceland. We built a small room out of stage-cloths, on the side of the stage.</em></p>

<h2 id="performances">Performances</h2>
<p>Isle of Games continues to try to find new ways for audiences to experience games. Five new collaborations took place between stage performers and video games. The response was overwhelmingly positive, and we encourage people to adopt and adapt this formula for their own events.</p>

<h3 id="irisvsabzu">Iris VS Abzu</h3>
<p>An eclectic underwater soundscape by musician and composer Iris Thorarins will accompany the game Abzu, live on stage.  </p>
<p>Composer Iris Thorarins re-scores the first areas of the game <a href="https://abzugame.com/">ABZÛ</a> for us, while also improvising foley and layering live instruments.
Debuting at last year's Isle of Games, this performance has been iterated upon and taken place multiple times throughout 2018 and 2019.</p>

<h3 id="thankyou">Thank you</h3>
<p>And that's that! Thanks for reading (or skimming) and please do let us know if any of the links or credits seem wrong or missing. We had a blast, and hope to return next year with a similarly impressive line-up. </p>
<p>Isle of Games would not have been possible without the help of many people. A special thanks goes out to the venue IÐNÓ and all the
volunteers, artists and performers who helped us build Isle of Games 002. We also wouldn’t be here without the generous help of our sponsors <a href="https://rawfury.com/">Raw Fury</a> and CCP. We'd also like to thank the volunteers who helped us set up, break down, move chairs and stay hydrated!</p>
